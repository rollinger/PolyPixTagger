The prototype v4 is 1400 lines of code.
- it is too big, too complex and not well structured.
- business logic is not separated from UI generation
- the code may also have duplicate code and code that may be refactored into more succint functions/methods.
- for the prototype I like to have it in a single file, but ready to be split into multiple files later on.

Please provide some high level refactoring suggestions for Qt 6 projects and specifically for the prototype v4.
